## Overview
Let me introduce Dobby which is question-answering system. Ask Dobby anything. He'll let you know everything he knows.

## Motivation
When you need information, you will ask someone you know or look up websites. However, information is fragmented, and it’s hard to say that our acquaintance knows everything. Therefore, we have decided to make question-answering system that can answer about everything through voice format.

## Main difference from existing product/solutions
-	Integrated information which can be easily accessed by users, including people with the disabled
-	The ability to know especially about information that university students want to know.
-	Improved Korean Natural Language Processing
-	Improved Information Retrieval
